# geokdbush-python
A geographic extension for kdbush, the fastest static spatial index for points in JavaScript, rewritten for Python.

It implements fast nearest neighbors queries for locations on Earth, taking Earth curvature and date line wrapping into account. Inspired by sphere-knn, but uses a different algorithm.
